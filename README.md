# Mecha Car R Analysis


#### Taking a look at the summary report below we can determine that the model's predictions would be accurate 71% of the time and  we as can also say that the slope of the model is not zero. Which would be helpful to plot the slope and visualize it against our dataset, but I was unable to plot in R.

#### Somewhat surprisingly, at least at first, ground clearance and vehicle length had more affect on MPG than other factors I previously would have given more weight to like vehicle weight or even all wheel drive (AWD). This could possibly be because a higher and larger vehicle would, by their size, affect factors like resistance while traveling down the road.

#### Below is a model looking at just vehicle length, hopefully, for further analysis and plotting.

#### This is an area of greater research that could be explored. What ground clearance is optimal for affecting MPG at different lengths? Obviously, a power column here would be helpful as well. Horsepower or engine size. I think most consumers look for a balance of power, gas economy, and comfort or rather personal preferences. A deeper look at the balance of power and gas consumption against our other biggest factors like ground clearence and length might lend to a balance where can find a place in the market or niche. Also, another area for analysis is comfort or technology preferences. What variables inside the vehicle have the highest impact on consumer's making the purchase?
